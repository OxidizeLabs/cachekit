# Policy Roadmap

These documents cover eviction policies that are planned but not yet implemented
in this repository. They describe expected behavior, metadata needs, and
implementation notes for future work.

If a policy moves into production code, its document should be moved back to
`docs/policies/` and listed under "Implemented" in `docs/policies/README.md`.
